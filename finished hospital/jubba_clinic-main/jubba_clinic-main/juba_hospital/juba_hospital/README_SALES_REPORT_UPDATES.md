## 📊 Understanding the Metrics

### Total Sales
**What it is:** All money received from customers  
**Example:** If you sold $1,000 worth of medicines, that's your Total Sales  
**Why it matters:** Shows your revenue

### Total Cost
**What it is:** What you paid for all the medicines you sold  
**Example:** If those medicines cost you $700, that's your Total Cost  
**Why it matters:** Shows your expenses

### Total Profit
**What it is:** Sales minus Cost (what you actually earned)  
**Example:** $1,000 - $700 = $300 profit  
**Why it matters:** This is your real earnings!

### Profit Margin
**What it is:** Profit as a percentage of sales  
**Example:** $300 profit / $1,000 sales = 30%  
**Why it matters:** Shows how efficiently you're making money  
**Good target:** 25-35% is typical for pharmacy

### Transactions
**What it is:** Number of sales you made  
**Example:** 28 customers bought medicine today  
**Why it matters:** Shows how busy you are

### Average Sale
**What it is:** Typical amount per customer  
**Example:** $1,000 sales / 28 customers = $35.71 average  
**Why it matters:** Helps set sales targets
